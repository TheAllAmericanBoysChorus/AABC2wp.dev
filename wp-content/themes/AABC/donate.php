        <h5>Decisions. Decisions.</h5>
        <p>It is remarkable to consider that only boys possess this extraordinary gift, but perhaps even more remarkable when one considers that they possess it only briefly. For a narrow window of time, a boy’s voice can be harnessed to uplift those who hear it and enhance the life of him who possesses it.</p>

        <h5>The Voice Of America And Its Future.</h5>
        <p>The All-American Boys Chorus is founded on the belief that boys have the potential for greatness. It is remarkable to consider a child in this way but we know it to be true. With training and determination, a boy’s voice produces a unique sound of unparalleled beauty that has been used for over a thousand years to entertain, uplift and inspire.</p>
